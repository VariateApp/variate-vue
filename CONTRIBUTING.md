# Contributing to Variate Vue

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

We use GitHub Flow, so all changes happen via pull requests. 

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs or request features using Github [Issues](https://github.com/VariateApp/variate-vue/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Use a consistent coding style

This repository is not using any styling convention yet, but it will come very soon.
